Description

Presents etree interface to netcdf4-python objects using NCML data model


This library attempts to provide a bridge to support uniform metadata operation in python on XML and NetCDF files using the LXML interface. As the name suggests, while a serious effort has been made to provide a clean and consistent interface which will support the weight of metadata management the library may be a bit cranky if you try to do things that don't make sense. So far I have only tried to support the key operations required for the wicken library.

Good luck
